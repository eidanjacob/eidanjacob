- 👋 Hi, I’m Eidan Jacob.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Statistics, Decision Theory, and AI, among many other things. I consider myself an aspiring rationalist and effective altruist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development to help my dad out with an informational page for his hospital department. But my main interests are about data analysis and various forms of decision-making under uncertainty.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a full-time position where I get to analyze data, make statistical models, or use decision theory. My latest resume is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZ5bDBsVuvA4U1yQdXOYUnGy74s1t1Tc/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>
- 📫 Please get in touch at my email: eidanjacob@gmail.com
